The Nutcracker and The Four Realms
Watched 12/2I can't give this movie a star rating, I never finished it. The first time I've walked out a film in 2018.I went into this movie with incredibly low expectations, I mainly just wanted to be swept up in big budget, Disney magic all shot on 70mm film. While the film was pretty and Disney has excellent set, costume, and production design, this movie is so slow, boring and dull it's just not worth it.While I truly appreciate the original take on a classic story the fact is there is nothing here worth fighting for. And when a film feels like a fight, thats a bad sign. The children in the theater were bored, many of them maniacally babbling to their parents about things I'm guessing they'd rather be doing. The highlight of the experience was a scene where it got insanely quiet and dramatic and one of the children in the theater let out a large burp. Alas, finally a smile and chuckle.There was a pretty good clown scene that takes place in a circus tent. As the Nutcracker soldier is slicing away at freakish, ornately decorated clowns, they jump and spin and cartwheel around him while hurling barely comprehensible insults. That in combination with the sativa edible I gobbled up in the parking lot began to take hold and suddenly for a few frightening moments the film was fascinating.But everything after that wasn't enough to keep me remotely interested. Sitting there begging to be entertained while hoping something nice to look at might eventually pop up is no way to see a film, so I left roughly halfway through.Am I a Scrooge? A Grinch? Is my heart three sizes too small? Not at all because those are two characters that make me love Christmas movies. The Nutcracker and The Four Realms was just coal, pure, black, dusty coal. Put it on your naughty list this year.The Nutcracker and The Four Realms
