I loved the scenery, the sets, and the costumes within this movie. They were wonderful to look at, but that was all this movie had going for it. Keira Knightly and Jayden Fowora-Knight were the only acting parts that were decent.While some parts of the movie were enjoyable, overall it was boring and I was unable to really get into it despite being excited.I loved the scenery, the sets, and the costumes within this movie.
