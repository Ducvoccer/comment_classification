Even people who never even heard of Tschaikovsky know about the Nutcracker. The same goes for people who never attend ballet performances. In short, the Nutcracker is the theatre equivalent of the Home Alone movies for the holiday season-a standard, albeit a kitschy one. But then again, kitsch goes with Christmas just as good as wine with good cheese. And yes, cheesy is one of numerous adjectives that come to mind when I think about this lates product of Lasse Halstrom's imagination. How can someone who produced masterpiece fairytales like "Chocolat" come up with something like this? It made me feel that the camera tape was made of cotton candy. Essentially, it's the "four realms" where things went terribly wrong. Instead of providing us with simple narrative, mountains of gingerbread and a touching sountrack (it's a Christmas ballet, not Star Wars), Hallstrom decides to introduce us to Clara, the main protagonist who happens to be a clever, innovative pre-feminist heroine stuck in Victorian patriarchy. She finds out her mother used to be a queen of a magical world that since turned into a rainbow-coloured chaos where Helen Mirren is dressed to kill in a castle shaped like a huge doll.
