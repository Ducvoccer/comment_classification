I paid for my ticket to see a nostalgic film from my childhood but what i got was a cheap badly directed film which is imbarasmend for the original story. The film was beautiful but why on earth would you change the whole world and story. All audience wants is the original story. Not some lame mix of "sequel" and original story which didnt work at all. If that wasnt bad enough, you left one of the most reconizable songs out of the movie.I paid for my ticket to see a nostalgic film from my childhood but what i got was a cheap badly directed film which is imbarasmend for the original story.
