This is set up very much like a children's elementary school play, and not the good ones. The story is very strange and kinda bizarre. They try too hard to make this film suspenseful that in the end it is not. I would wait for this on streaming, not worth the theatre high prices! This is disappointing that it is coming from disney.This is set up very much like a children's elementary school play, and not the good ones. The story is very strange and kinda bizarre.
