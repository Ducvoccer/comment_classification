They did such a awesome job with beauty and the beast. So i thought i would give it a try. To many things wrong with this movie. its not exciting enough, the story is too bland and generic. Terrible voice acting along with bad sound editing, i could barely make out what the terrible accent Foy and knightly were saying. They definitely need to raise the volume of the voice. I'm not a fan of ballet, they incorporated a lot of that into the movie. Not sure that was a good thing. I dunno, feels like a made for TV movie more than a theatrical release.They did such a awesome job with beauty and the beast. So i thought i would give it a try.
