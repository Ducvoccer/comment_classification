There must been a lot of group think around this movie. Or, Disney has taken on more projects than they can handle. I have genuinely enjoyed the disney movies I have taken my children to in the past few years. This one... did not reach mediocre status. It had potential, and was beautiful. But the story was just not there, the characters were one-dimensional, and several moments were deeply uncomfortable. There were moments between the father and Clara that felt awkward at best, and a little insidious at worst. It is just a really disappointing end product, and I hope that they have done better with their other movies that are set to come out soon.There must been a lot of group think around this movie.
