Yes worst, along side Wrinkle in Time.
I think i'm done with girlish fantasy adventure movie genre.I though it'll tell us more about the Nutcracker and the Four Realms, turn out he only appears as a side character, and we only see glimpse of four realms from the ballet play, one that one ballet on this movie who's supposedly famous because ballet. I didnt stop yawning and rolling my eyes watching it. What a waste of great casts. I hate Keira Knightley's voice here by the way, so annoying.Damn, and i watched it on capital city's theatre, on Saturday night, was quite expensive. I regret it so much-"-Yes worst, along side Wrinkle in Time.
