When seeing the trailer for 'The Nutcracker and the Four Realms' seeing 'Christopher Robin' in the cinema a few months ago, it immediately went high up on my most anticipated films of the year list and one of the films that left me desperate and impatient to see it. Simply adore the 'Nutcracker' story, have read it and seen the ballet and many adaptations of it so many times, and Tchaikovsky's music and the cast involved boasted a lot of talent. How could it go wrong?
