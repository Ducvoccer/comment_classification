The special effects and artistic style are a visual treat full of colour and magic, and the classical music is great and used to good effect. However, the story has been modernized and now includes far too much additional stuff - unnecessary characters, barely referenced realms, fight scenes and ballet all in quick succession. I found it slow and boring at times, with its relatively straightforward plot and sloppy editing, and wondered who it was aimed at - younger audiences would be scared by the menacing monsters, older children wouldn't be interested, and adults would probably enjoy the ballet more.The special effects and artistic style are a visual treat full of colour and magic, and the classical music is great and used to good effect.
