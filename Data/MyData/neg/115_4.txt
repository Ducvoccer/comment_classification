This movie is not good but small children may like it. The manuscript was really bad but the surrounding environment was partly beautiful and the directing wasn't all bad. The jokes was terrible and not even children will problably laugh to this movie. The only good acting performances was made by Morgan Freeman and Matthew Macfadyen. The CGI has gotten to much focus in the reviews, it's sometimes bad and sometimes better but not the main error in the movie, the opening is for example not bad at all. Again, children might like it since they not focus in the dialogue as much and will not notice all predictible clich√©s, but adults will not like it.
