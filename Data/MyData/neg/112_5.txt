Before actually seeing this film, I have to admit that I was hyped for this film. I've liked Disney's live action adaptations, and yes that includes Alice in Wonderland. The film looked like it would carry the form of a very excellent Beauty and the Beast from last year. The film had a good cast, looked grand viscerally, what could go wrong, right? Absolutely everything. This film was a massive disappointment almost from its opening frame. I'm actually surprised at how big of a misfire this was.
