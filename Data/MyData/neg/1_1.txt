So basically, in the Nutcracker movie the "Nutcracker" did nothing! It was all about the girl. They changed the plot so much it was basically Alice in Wonderland with no action. peek of the film was soo underwhelming it upset me. Also used all the cliché things from Narnia, Harry Potter, Alice in Wonderland and some other movies. It was basically quick money grab for Disney. i gave one star for the costume design.So basically, in the Nutcracker movie the "Nutcracker" did nothing! It was all about the girl.
