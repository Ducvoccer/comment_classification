Disney really, REALLY needs to stop with this switching the good guys and the bad guys from the original stories. Didn't they learn with the tragedy that was Maleficent? Seriously, what if when the Harry Potter novels were made into movies and they suddenly revealed that Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix were evil and Voldemort and the Death Eaters were the good guys for a twist. Or if in Star Wars they suddenly revealed that Darth Vader and the Empire were the good guys and Yoda and the Jedi were evil. This time they made the Mouse King good and Sugar Plum evil. Please, Disney, just stop, it isn't working.
