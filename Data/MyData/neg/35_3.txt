I saw this movie with my 10 year old daughter, who thought it was bad, and I had to agree. This movie's script is terrible, and I'm tempted to go into this and discuss how I think it could have been improved, but I won't. I just want to highlight some of the strange messages one can get from it. (Spoilers ahead.)
