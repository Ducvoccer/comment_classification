I enjoyed this movie. It has some surprises and visually impressive. However, to have Morgan Freeman as her Godfather was a bit much. All I could think is how he doesn't like Trump. They need to keep their opinions to themselves. Other than him i enjoyed this movie but my husband did sleep through it.I enjoyed this movie. It has some surprises and visually impressive.
