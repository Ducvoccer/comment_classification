It's hard to imagine that anyone would want more Tchaikovsky. You've seen the ballet. You've heard the music in every mall and if you were ever a dancer you've danced it. But the weird modernized version in this movie will make you want to just hear damned Tchaikovsky.
I felt the same about the dancing. Show me at least a little more dancing.
The serious problem with this movie that really burned me though was the treatment of Misty Copeland. If you even have a passing knowledge of her you've seen those calves and shoulders. She's the single most striking dancer of our time. What is the deal with not showing her face and having her say at least one line? Frankly it just struck me as racist.
It's hard to lean on the plot of a ballet that essentially has no plot. It makes for a thin movie that needs more Tchaikovsky, more dance and more Misty Copeland.It's hard to imagine that anyone would want more Tchaikovsky. You've seen the ballet.
