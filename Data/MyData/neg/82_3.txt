Is it truly worth the time, funds and effort to produce films if they are not something unique or maybe pushing the bounds a little, or throwing us a little uniqueness? The nutcracker was sweet but lacked real heart, uniqueness and a memorable feeling. Having watched attentively (with effort to keep up the attention) I couldn't help feel that I was straining to stay interested and waiting for the meaningful events or punchline to kick in. It seems we have become okay with mediocre but still expensive entertainment. Hopefully movie makers will continue to strive to entertain and not simply regurgitate ideas as this film sadly did. Either way, a big big thanks to the actors and entire army of people that strove to produce this pretty film! The ballet was wonderful and the racial diversity of the actors was great:)Is it truly worth the time, funds and effort to produce films if they are not something unique or maybe pushing the bounds a little, or throwing us a little uniqueness?
