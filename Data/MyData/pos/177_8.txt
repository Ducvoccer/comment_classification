This was really the perfect movie to go see with your family over the Thanksgiving holiday, and if it holds at the box office, a great one to see around Christmas as well. Bolstered by two earnest performances from Mark Wahlberg and Rose Byrne, and a lovely script, Instant Family may be an instant family classic. I can't believe I'm saying that considering how bad those trailers were, but there's something about watching a genuinely well done family drama that really hits home with me. It had shades of Gifted and The Intern in all the best ways. Is it melodramatic and cheesy at times? Oh absolutely. Would I watch this again and recommend it to any family? 100%. When a film knows what it is and succeeds at what it sets out to do, it's truly a beautiful thing.8.9/10
