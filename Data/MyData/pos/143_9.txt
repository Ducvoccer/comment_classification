From watching the trailers I assumed this was going to be a silly comedy movie. Walking into the theater I wasn't expecting much, the movie delivered so much more than I could have expected.
For starters it had good cinematography, it had some really good shots. You don't usually get good camera work in movies like this.
It's also the rare type of movie that gives you a good laugh while at the same time makes you tear up a bit.
Lots of family movies come out around November and December for the holiday season, and I think so far this one is the best one. Not only is it funny, it teaches a very good lesson about family and gratefulness. It was amazing the lengths this couple went through to protect their children even if they weren't they're biological parents. And the fact that it was based on a true story made the film so much more meaninful. It also sheds some light on the foster care system in our country, I hope that it encourages more people to foster and adopt children.
