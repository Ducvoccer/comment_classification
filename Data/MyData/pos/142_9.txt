Absolutely hilarious movie with elements of depressing, sad, funny, and downright how do you not laugh. Perfect film. Critics that dont like it literally have been paid to say otherwise or do not have any hearts. Probably funniest movie ive seen in 10 years. No way someone could not like this movie or find humor in it. I call BS.
