This was a pleasant surprise. Instead of only being based on the ballet (which, to me, has beautiful dance but lacks narrative) it is a hybrid of the ballet and the book THE NUTCRACKER AND THE MOUSE KING. This is a beautiful, creative, imaginative, skillfull, and layered production. There is the excellence of Misty Copeland as the Ballerina Princess, the ingenue charm of MacKenzie Foy, the veteran performances of Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren and Keira Knightly, the beautiful set pieces that made the realms so real, the comedic and the menacing elements of story, the real loss of our protagonist and the resolving discoveries ("missing is remembering" was a powerful thought), wonderful music, and an abundance of imagination and whimsy. I really liked this film, and give it an 8 (great) out of 10. {Fantastic Adventure}This was a pleasant surprise.
