As you may heard it before that The Nutcracker and the Four Realms only got 39 on Metascore. However, I don't think this is a fair score. TNFR is a typical Disney PG movie which made for children. It means that you cannot judge it by using a adult's view. I fully agree that if you are an adult, you will find it tell a so simple story with a terrible way. But if consider yourself as a children which you may find every factors are special designed for this group. First is the time, only 1hr 39min, which also is the longest time that a child may sit still. Every line and the way tell the story are all easy for a child to understand. You may find out that sugar lady is the villain as soon as you saw her, but kids can't as smart as you. Additionally, I want to criticize the media review here. They do give a fair score sometimes but sometimes they just ignore some important factors like what kind of audience is this movie facing to? Can not blindly pursue the artistry of the film with adult eyes, especially such fairy tale movies like this.
At last, Foy need to working harder on her performance, a great job she have done though.As you may heard it before that The Nutcracker and the Four Realms only got 39 on Metascore.
