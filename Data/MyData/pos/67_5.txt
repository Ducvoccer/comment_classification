When I think of the Nutcracker, I think of the magic of Christmas, that kind of magic that inexplicably makes unbearableall all the hassle related to Christmas. It's like the effect of a drug. But if the Christmas atmosphere is a drug, this film is the equivalent of an overdose. Disney has, as often happens, exaggerated. Someone should explain them that more is not always better. The only moment of true grace in this Christmas circus put on by Disney, is given by the performance of two exceptional classic dancers, Sergei Polunin and Misty Copeland.
Totally inexplicable was the little emphasis given to the present of the best dancer in the world, but probably the marketing department was too busy with sugar sticks and ginger biscuits under steroids, to deal with true art. Fortunately, Polunin needs no introduction and in the few minutes he appears, accompanied beautifully by Misty Copeland, even a Nutcracker without Tchaikovsky's music seems acceptable!When I think of the Nutcracker, I think of the magic of Christmas, that kind of magic that inexplicably makes unbearableall all the hassle related to Christmas.
