Really I hardly ever like movies at the theater anymore. This was worth every penny. Our whole family saw it (including the kids 8,15) they all LOVED it and it's our favorite movie. Nothing crazy inappropriate if you aren't way too picky. This was HILARIOUS!!! The entire theater wasn't laughing, CLAPPING, and then crying here and there ðŸ˜‚ there was so many more funny moments though. It was so heartwarming.... just an all around great movie. We were pleasantly surprised.
