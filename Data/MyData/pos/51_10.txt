Critics are too hard! This movie wasnt a masterpiece by any length, but it was a cute and beautifully done film. Visually stunning, with amazing CGI settings and immenseley detailed costumes. It was a bit predictable plot wise, but one must remember it's a children's movie heavily dealing with the theme of grief over a lost loved one. Good acting with cute and memorable characters. Great for a family night out!Critics are too hard! This movie wasnt a masterpiece by any length, but it was a cute and beautifully done film.
