It is a fairy tale that is a period piece.Great casting and acting.It's wonderfully imaginative.It has a great color palette.It is a good adventure that engages the viewer.It entertains at many levels and ages; 5-50 (my personal tribe). We will see it again on the big screen.Great cinematography, lighting, and editing; keeps you engaged and present in the film and story.The elite class of viewers, also known as critics, went the wrong way in their echo chamber.This will become a staple in my family's holiday viewing tradition AND I hope those reading this have an opportunity to see it on a big screen.It is a fairy tale that is a period piece.Great casting and acting.It's wonderfully imaginative.It has a great color palette.It is a good adventure that engages the viewer.It entertains at many levels and ages; 5-50 (my personal tribe).
