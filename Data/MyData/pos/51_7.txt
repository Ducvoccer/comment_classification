I mean, This movies doesn't have the most elaborate of stories, but if you go in expecting a cute princessy disneysy christmas story, you won't be THAT disapointed. The visuals are stunning, and so is Mackenzie Foy (I feel like they knew that, because there were lots of shots of her face). Her acting was adequate, and this movies doesn't lack big names.
