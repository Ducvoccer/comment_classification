I knocked a few stars off because the first 30 minutes or so are really clunky and the story just doesn't flow. Perhaps not trying to shove the ballet in there would have been better. They didn't shove the ballet into Sleeping Beauty, they just had the music. They changed directors throughout the film and it shows. But the rest of it is wonderful! I don't understand why some people are so hard on 2010's Alice in Wonderland.I have played in the pit orchestra for this ballet BTW........I knocked a few stars off because the first 30 minutes or so are really clunky and the story just doesn't flow.
