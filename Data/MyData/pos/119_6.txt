The Nutcracker And The Four Realms is about a girl gets a present from her mother and it is locked. She asks her uncle and he gives her a gift that takes her into a magical land. She finds out the land is in needs her help to stop the war.The Nutcracker And The Four Realms was a fun Christmas movie. It was enjoyable but the story wasn't really there. There was a story but there were many holes or gaps in the story, It made you leave asking how stuff even happened. The acting was good. Morgan Freeman played an enjoyable grand father and Mackenzie Foy did a good job. The only actor that I thought had a weird role was Keira Knightly. She was like a cartoon. She wasn't the best they could have gotten.The Nutcracker And The Four Realms was a fun Christmas movie for the whole family.The Nutcracker And The Four Realms is about a girl gets a present from her mother and it is locked.
