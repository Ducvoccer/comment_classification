Disney, Disney, Disney WHAT THE HELL WAS THIS MEANT TO BE? Watching the Nutcracker years ago when I was younger, I kind of understand the story is the certain way, although this film feels more of a sequel than a remake of the Nutcracker since the story is based on the mouse king.Looking at reviews most of judge=ing this as a great film because of it costume design, which yes I will admit the costume design and set-piece are well done, but what people don't seem to understand material things don't make a film as a whole great.Don't get me wrong Mackenzie Foy beautiful actress, her performance carries the film I would go as far as to say solid acting with what she was given, Matthew Macfadyen done great for his role as well as Morgan Freeman.With set piece and costume design does bring this film out in Disney style film, but this film was heavily flawed and cringe-worthy for a nutcracker film.Dislikes: WOW this film seriously sucks, I don't mean this in a nasty way, I mean this is a seriously bad written film that completely lost the identity of the Nutcracker, not to meantion the very adventure of the Nutcracker.Where was the flair and adventure the Nutcracker story has the sense of danger, im sorry but this felt like an on-screen Stage show you would see at the Stage Theatre in some Parody of itself, with a bunch of tired Disney cliches and bad casting and no to mention force diversity from someone that cant acted im sorry but Jayden Fowora-Knight acting felt so forced in this film it didn't feel natural like his been acting for a long timeDon't get me started on the casting Jack Whitehall for this film, was his scene meant to be funny, because they were, I found myself shaking my head at these scene with the cringe on just how bad casting this was. The weak plot line twist of a villian not being who you would think it was it's so cringe-worthy it was unreal, it's like the film was trying to be three things.It's like the film was trying to be a style of Narina with an epic story yet fall completely on its faces, with a ballerina stage style film while trying to be a film, these two things don't work, your iver trying to be the film or a Stage Theatre Parody with stupid jokes.Im being honest this is the worst Disney adaption they've done, Maleficent and Beauty and the beast disney Adaptions were good, this film sorry is the worst disney film ive ever had to sit through, it completes lost it identity lost its epic and heroic adventure with some of the worst acting for a few actors.Not a film for Adult nor is it the Nutcracker we all know, it's just a shame because Mackenzie Foy was the only thing perfect in character writing in such a badly written film.Overall: Not the Nutcracker with a cringe-worthy acting and lose of idenity, worst lazy written film from disney that I feel will flop with a weak plotDisney, Disney, Disney WHAT THE HELL WAS THIS MEANT TO BE?
