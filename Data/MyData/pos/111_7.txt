I saw "The Nutcracker and the Four Realms", starring Mackenzie Foy-Interstellar, The Conjuring; Keira Knightly-The Pirates of the Caribbean movies, Bend it Like Beckham; Morgan Freeman-Ted 2, Red and Helen Mirren-Collateral Beauty, the Red movies.
This is a Disney movie that I think should have been released a little closer to Christmas. It seems like it would be a better time for it-not right after Halloween. Mackenzie plays a young girl that is celebrating her first Christmas since her mother's death. As you can guess, it's not a happy time for her. That is until she opens a present her mother left for her. The only problem is that she can not open it-it needs a key. Her mother was an inventor and left her the puzzle and Morgan-a close friend of her mother's-helps point Mackenzie to an alternate world in search of the key, where she also learns about secrets that her mother had. This new world has 4 realms-Land of Snowflakes, Land of Flowers, Land of Sweets and the dreaded fourth mysterious realm-with Keira and Helen as two of the rulers. There are several dance numbers, including ballet, and the music is a mixture of both new and old-New being James Newton Howard and old being Tchaikovsky. It was an enjoyable movie but I just think it would do better box office if it would have been released closer to Christmas.
It's rated "PG" for mild peril and has a running time of 1 hour & 39 minutes.
I liked it and would buy it on DVD.I saw "The Nutcracker and the Four Realms", starring Mackenzie Foy-Interstellar, The Conjuring; Keira Knightly-The Pirates of the Caribbean movies, Bend it Like Beckham; Morgan Freeman-Ted 2, Red and Helen Mirren-Collateral Beauty, the Red movies.
