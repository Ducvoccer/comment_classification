Another reason this movie hit home with us was many years ago my wife and I fostered, then adopted a child who grew fully into middle age when he died of natural causes. We are both caucasian and he was half Native American and half Mexican. We added one more complication by having a child from natural child birth with whom he always thought he had to compete. I think he finally realized that was not so. We loved him for him, and had the instant connection they talk about in the movie. From day 1 he was our son. But while he was growing up we all went through the trials described in the movie, he trying to figure out who he was and us trying to figure out how to help. We were lost most of the time, but never stopped loving him. Once he figured out who he was he became a huge success in his life and I hope and think he died happy, loving what he was doing. I don't know if we helped with that or not. But I finally get to my point, the writers and the movie do a good job depicting this.
