I first saw The Nutcracker when I was apparently too young to enjoy it. According to my mom, I leaned over to tell her that there wasn't any words. However, some years later, I saw a televised performance and became entranced, even buying the book in recent years. That being said, this is NOT the same adventure. Does it mean it's bad? No. It's still thrilling and magical but definitely different. I enjoyed the changes and the scenery was breathtaking.I first saw The Nutcracker when I was apparently too young to enjoy it.
