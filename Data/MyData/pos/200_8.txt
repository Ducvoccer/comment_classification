And I came out in tears. There's lots of laughs, but just as many moving moments you wouldn't expect in a Mark Wahlberg movie.
Maybe because I've been involved in a similar situation, this movie really moved me.
Marky Mark is his usual great in this. Rose Byrne apparently is the new Leslie Mann. She was made to look and act exactly like her.
The supporting cast is awesome, with Margo Martindale her usual blast of energy. Also Julie Haggarty from Airplane!, and Michael O'Keefe from Caddyshack are perfect. And of course, Octavia Spencer rocks it. And Joan Cusack. Boom.
