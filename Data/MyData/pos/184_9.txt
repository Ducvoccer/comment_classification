I've worked in public child welfare for most of my life and have seen a few movie's/tv shows centering on the foster care system. This is one of the best and most realistic depictions that I've seen. Sure there were comic elements to bring in the casual viewer; after all you've got to draw an audience. Sure, there were a couple of scenes that may have been a bit unrealistic, but after all it is a movie. With those things aside, most of the rest of the movie was accurate and showed many themes that families, the foster families and social workers deal with all the time. Among these were foster families getting into this because it makes them feel good, rather than being exclusively about the children, the parentified older child with younger siblings, the acting out behavior of children that has trauma as its root cause, etc. There was only one scene that I didn't care for. That was when Octavia Spencer laughed at the notion that the father may have been involved. That's the stereotype and in some cases it's true, but in many more cases it isn't. Sometimes it means that social workers and other professionals need to do a better job of engaging the dads. Overall, a very good movie.
