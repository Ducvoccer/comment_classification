Based off of the promotions, I expected this movie the be a little hokey; that's was not the case for the most part. Yes, there are predictable moments and some relationships you just have to trust without too much background, but that feels like par for the course in making a family movie. What matters is you feel for the characters, you enjoy the comedic diversions, and tune in to the serious messages as they creep in. If you're looking for an overall feel good film, this is your ticket. It's worth a watch!
