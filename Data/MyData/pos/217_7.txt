This is a 7 in my book. I'm not sure what it is, but Mark Wahlberg's acting feels unemotional to me sometimes. And in this movie people seemingly talked way too fast. I'm not sure if it was the editing but it felt like a race to the finish of the conversation between multiple people in several scenes.But there were some sad scenes that tugged at the heart. Like I said, solid "7".
