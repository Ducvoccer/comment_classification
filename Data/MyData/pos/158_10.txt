OK, It's a chick flick. But, Mark Wahlberg is in it so its cool. Plus, if you are a family guy, you'll love it for that too. Hey, you'll enjoy it yourself and you'll get family bonus points for taking them to see it. Final point, it's money well spent. Just go see it. You won't find a more enjoyable movie that you can take your whole family to.
