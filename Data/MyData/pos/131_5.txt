The costumes and cinematography are per usual Disney. The acting felt contrived and the story was clunky. I love Kiera Knightley, but the role of Sugarplum was just terrible. It had little to do with her acting ability and much more to do with the character.The costumes and cinematography are per usual Disney. The acting felt contrived and the story was clunky.
