My daughter really wanted to see this movie and I always look up reviews so seeing all the horrible ones about this movie I was not looking forward to seeing it at all. I even tried to get her to switch and see the Grinch when we were at the ticket counter, however this was the movie she had been wanting to see. Well I must say that this movie was a beautiful surprise, we both loved. The costumes, the scenery, it was all so amazing and beautiful . However I do think I now know why it has so many BAD reviews. This movie seems like the first really G rated movie I've taken my child to in a while, it was not filled with booty shaking, vulgar undertones, gross humor , rap music , inside adult jokes etc . If that is what you are expecting, and if that the only type of movies your child like just skip this movie.My daughter really wanted to see this movie and I always look up reviews so seeing all the horrible ones about this movie I was not looking forward to seeing it at all.
