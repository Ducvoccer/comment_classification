This film had so much potential for a family focused audience that was slighted heavily by the vulgar language in the compelling screenplay. The film was truly funny, but it it was inappropriate for children who should have been welcomed by producer Mark Wahlberg. The film is not only inappropriate for children, but it failed to entertain Christians, because of the vulgar language. The story was so meaningful, but the heavy language was a major disappointment. I made the mistake of sharing this film with my kids and they were exposed to in an obviously offensive way.
