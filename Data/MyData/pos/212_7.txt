First of all, I will start by saying I liked the film. The message was a great one, and gives a clever way of describing the foster world, and how it affects the kids, birth parents, and foster parents. It had a few funny moments but I wasn't falling over my seat for laughter. Having Wahlberg play a different kind of role was great to see. Some of the acting by the younger kids, especially the small girl wasn't that great, but their cuteness made up for the lack of acting. They are young, so I can't really critique that much.
If you are looking for a feel-good movie with a few laughs, this is for you.
