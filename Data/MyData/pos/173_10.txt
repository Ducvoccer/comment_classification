I wasn't expecting to almost cry three times in this movie but I did. Started off a bit fast but I was fully invested mid-way through till the end. I really enjoyed the different personalities of all the characters.Also, it is nice to see new comedic actors. I really enjoyed the Russ character played by Tom Segura, and hope to see him in more films. Will definitely recommend this movie to others!
