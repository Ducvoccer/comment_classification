Agghhh. I gave it 5 because I left the theatre loving the cinematography. Yet, as I came home and digested this movie I realized all the plot holes and characters that were introduced and.....well that's it. They were all just introduced. I feel as though this was a part 1 in a series because of all the unanswered questions, and knowing Disney...it probably is. I wasn't as annoyed with the acting as other reviewers seemed to be...just the potential of a beautiful world and story. I've never seen the nutcracker ballet, or know the story too well. So I'm not sure how "Christmasy" the original story is, but I was expecting THIS depiction to be a tad more of a holiday movie. What it actually turned out to be was Alice in Wonderland with different costumes...Agghhh. I gave it 5 because I left the theatre loving the cinematography.
