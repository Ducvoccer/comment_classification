The only plus points are:
1. Visually extravagant sets and beautiful locales
2. Casting of Clara was perfect
3. The musicEverything else is terrible.
1. Most of the actors have given robotic, fake performances. Keira Knightly is the absolute worst - fake, pretenscious arrogance. The cast, though reputed, wasn't given enough bandwidth.
2. The story. Absolute terrible story, why can't you just stick to the original Mouse King story? Where was the Mouse King? I kept waiting and waiting.. Moreover the story is far too simplistic.
3. Terrible direction and script. Boring, mundane dialogues not worthy of Disney.
4. Felt like a repeat of Alice in Wonderland and Wizard of Oz with a dark setting.OH Disney! The other live action remakes were so good! Why did you mess up the Nutcracker story? It's such a beautiful one!The only plus points are:
