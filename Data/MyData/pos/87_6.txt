Most part of the movie is very boring. I almost fell asleep if Keria Knightley didn't become bad. The scene is beautiful . I think it will wow little girls. But for me, it's not that attracting. And for the story, not exciting at all. Just an average fantasy film.Most part of the movie is very boring. I almost fell asleep if Keria Knightley didn't become bad. The scene is beautiful .
