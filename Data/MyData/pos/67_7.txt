Dear Disney lovers, The Nutracker and the Four Realms is coming beautifully as we seen other Disney movies. For me, still the perfect story and cinematography is Narnia series, but here we can also entertain ourselves by the imagination of each character, especially the new coming Hollywood idol Mackenzie Foy and the previous idol, Keira Knightley. Nutracker story is coming from imagination of a child that lost her mother and jump into adventure in other world, just like Narnia, Alice in Wonderland, Sophie's World, and Wizard of Oz. Thank you to the Editorial and Animator team that entertain our eyes since the beginning. You know, having such a good animation is so hard in my country, because perhaps it lacks some technologies. But here, Disney team can create a very good movie for everybody. Still they have some philosophical explanation for some symbols. Four realms can represent four continent and which continent is the most greediest among others. Here also we can see black male character not just white heroes. The castile, soldiers, Mother Ginger, Mousechick, Godfather, and even Owl I believe there are some meanings in our real life. Really appreciate this kind of animation movie and yes I am waiting Grinch for this Christmas!
