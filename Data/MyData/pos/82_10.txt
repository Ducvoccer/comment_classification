This was a very well done production. The music was wonderful, both the actual Nutcracker music written by Pyotr Tchaikovsky,and the original score. Costumes, special effects, and sets are worth seeing in themselves. Kiera Knightly is fantastic as Sugarplum and the lead Mackenie Foy was nice to watch. I can't understand all the negative comments; although, probably those that do not have an appreciation for the arts may not enjoy it as much as those that do.This was a very well done production.
