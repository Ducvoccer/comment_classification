Instant Family is an instant hit. It was so fun to watch. I found myself actually laughing out loud during the course of the movie. Usually, I don't like movies where everything ends up okay but I liked this one. As a child who's experienced adoption and family court, I felt like this movie, albeit a little dramatic, saw how it felt to be a part of the system. A great movie!
