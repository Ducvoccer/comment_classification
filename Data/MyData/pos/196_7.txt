I left the theater feeling good and that's what it's all about. "Instant Family" stumbles around a bit before it gets into it's groove. By the end it touches all of the bases and delivers nicely. "Instant Family"'s heart is in the right place and it gets a lot of points for that. Sometimes it's okay to grade on a curve.
