This was a surprisingly terrific and hillarious film that I enjoyed from start to finish. The story it tells is one that people of all ages and backgrounds will enjoy. What makes this film special though are the comedic performances from each and every actor. Every single one of them is at the top of their game.Director Sean Anders has delivered his best work with "Instant Family" and I eagerly await his next picture. The true winner of this movie though was standup comedian Tom Segura, who delivered maybe the most captivating supporting acting performances in a comedy since Steve Carell in "Anchorman". Mr. Segura is a true master of his craft, as his clinically sociopathic personality mixes with comedy to create a perfect cocktail. Perhaps the only flaw of this movie is that Segura was not given more screen time. I look forward to seeing Anders and the acting champ working together again soon, and I predict that the best is yet to come from Mr. Segura, who is sure to have secured a place as a future leading man in Hollywood comedy.Go see "Instant Family" while you have the chance. Just try it out. You'll love it.
