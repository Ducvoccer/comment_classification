Pete (Mark Wahlberg) and Ellie (Rose Byrne) are a childless couple who renovate and flip houses. When Ellie's sister announces she and her husband are trying to get pregnant, Pete starts a conversation with Ellie about why they never had children. They don't quite know the answer. Soon after, the couple takes a look at foster children who are on the verge of being adoptable. Sharon (Octavia Spencer) and Karen (Tig Nitaro) are two likeable, truthful social workers who teach foster parent classes and hold adoption events. P and E take the classes, go to spy out a good-fit foster child. As they approach a group of teens, an outspoken foster girl, Lizzie (Isabela Monar) tells them they don't need to look them over, the teens know no one wants them. Oh, but now they do! Amazingly, Lizzie has two younger siblings, Juan and Lita, so Pete and Ellie agree to take all three. What a challenge for the family, including loveable dog Meatball. Lita only wants to eat potato chips, Juan is accident prone, and Lizzie is gradually more and more defiant to rules. Then, just as things get slightly better, the natural mother comes back in the picture and may want the trio returned to her. Can you say heartbreak? This lovely funny tale of trials and joys of adopting older children is wonderful. Wahlberg and Byrne are quite fine as the realistic couple with love in their hearts and fumbles in their parenting skills. Monar is fabulous as the rebellious teen while the rest of the cast, including sensational Margo Martindale, are likewise priceless. The settings, costumes, script and direction contribute to the final result of one grand movie. Don't wait an instant, movie lovers! This one is a timeless tale of love springing from tragic circumstances.
