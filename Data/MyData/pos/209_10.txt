I've never given anything a 10/10. Ever. But this film is perfect. So funny yet manages to keep so much heart without being cheesy! I've been through the licensing process for Foster care and this movie is a very realistic, and at times very tough, view into the world. Perfect cast, just the right amount of laugh moments through the tears. I'll see it again and again and recommend to everyone.
