I don't understand why this film has so many hateful reviews. As someone who loves Disney movies, I can safely say I thouroughly enjoyed this. I don't know a great deal about the original story or the ballet, but the film stands on it's own very well. Although I felt I was watching a spin-off of Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland in parts, my high expectations for the film did not disappoint.
I felt every actor fitted their role perfectly, espically Mackenzie Foy, who in some ways brought the entire film to life. It's not without it's flaws, but don't go to watch this film with the expectation that it'll be anything more than a coming of age story made by Disney. It's not phenomenal, but it's perfect for people who want to watch a decent family film. I get that it's not everyone's type of movie, but give it a chance and you might actually enjoy it.I don't understand why this film has so many hateful reviews.
