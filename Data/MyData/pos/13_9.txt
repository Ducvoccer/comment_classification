The Nutcracker and the Four Realms is a really magical movie. Full of Christmas and Magic. Featuring stunning sets and costumes and a good moral. The plot of this new adaptation of the Ballet and the Classic story that inspired it revolves around Clara a young girl who's mother has recently past away. On Christmas eve she discovers , with a little help from her Godfather Drosselmeyer played by Oscar Winner Morgan Freeman , A Magical World consisting of Four Realms each ruled by different regent. Three of the realms are good and peaceful. But one is dark and evil and ruled by the villainess Mother Ginger played by Oscar winner Helen Mirren.This is the kind of big budget Fantasy movie i love ! The sets and costumes are colorful and intricate, the cast has big stars playing larger than life roles and it has a good moral about believing in yourself and grief.The movie has magic and a good midway twist. Mackenzie Foy does a good job playing the lead and among the other actors Keira Knightley is a stand out , giveing her character a unique voice and set of mannerisms. The movie also really gives you a christmas feeling with all its snow , Christmas trees and presents. Richard E Grant and mexican comedy super star Eugenio Derbez also does a good job with their roles though both are slightly underused. Misty Copeland's role is also very small and i didn't even notice Miranda Hart. Actually i'm not even sure she was in the movie. Maybe her role has been cut from the finished film. I know there were reshoots. Speaking of shooting. The Director is a country man noted Swedish Director Lasse Hallström. But all the reshoots were handled by Joe Johnston( Captain America the First Avenger and Jurassic Park III). I don't know which filmed which scenes. Special shoutout must go to Two Time Oscar Nominee Guy Hendrix Dyas from his Production Design and Two Time Oscar Winner Jenny Beavan for her Costumes.It's a really good movie, I highly recommend it !The Nutcracker and the Four Realms is a really magical movie.
