I don't get all the negative reviews. It's definitely worth a watch and my daughter gave it a 10/10. Kept my interest and I didn't use the 1.5 hours to catch up on sleep which is the first sign it was a good film. Some of the acting is a bit questionable but let's not get too deep here. It was a magical film to get you in the mood for xmas!!I don't get all the negative reviews. It's definitely worth a watch and my daughter gave it a 10/10.
