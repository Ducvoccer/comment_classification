I see Wahlberg as the macho manly man with big muscles and cool moves and a soft enough heart. Easy to cheer for him. He seems to influence how I view the world as I watch him act.Rose Byrne was a perfect counter balance.I found the movie to be heart warming and refreshingly honest and non judgmental.A great date night.
