I wondered if the many rave customer reviews of this movie here were fraudulent, cause that happens. It seems they could be real. Based on a true story, this movie is heart-warming in a modern way without being cloying. The story is absorbing. Although it has some difficult parts, this is still an enjoyable movie compared to your other options. The PG-13 rating seems accurate.Instant Family tells the story of a prosperous white couple who impulsively decide to take in a foster child. The child they selected is one of a group of three siblings. Mistakes happen, but so do a lot of other things. If this movie has a message it could be that you don't have to be perfect and that love, care and persistence could eventually matter more than anything else.I like the editing: the movie moves along. There were outstanding performances by Isabela Moner as the oldest foster child and Margo Martindale as the foster grandmother who is a force of nature. Actually all the child and teen actors did great jobs because I forgot they were acting. Julianna Gamiz and Gustavo Quiroz played the younger foster children perfectly. Carson Holmes was compelling as a high school student who has a memorable encounter with some of the main characters. Rose Bryne rang true as the foster mom.Obviously when this many performances go well, director Sean Anders did a good job. The story is supposed to be based on his life.If this movie has a fault, I'd say that it looks like there was too much improv. When the foster parents support group ridicules some parents for laughs, it made me cringe. I hope that did not happen in real life. A cameo by Joan Cusack looked like it got out of hand, like when characters keep trying to top each other, and everything gets out of control.Although about two hours, I didn't find this movie to be overly long.I'm a tough customer, and I'm no shill.
