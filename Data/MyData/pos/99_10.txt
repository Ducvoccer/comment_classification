I loved every single bit of this movie-from beginning to end!Where to even begin: the cast; the costumes; the familiar crossover of the classic we've all seen in some variation or another throughout the years.I loved the whimsy of it all... the ease with which the characters lept from the screen and captured your attention with each moment. And, there was humor! I loved Whitehall making an appearance-any sort of silliness like that just makes my day.I loved the sincerity with which Clara's character searched for answers, for true meaning in it all-I felt I could relate to that sense of loss most of us have unfortunately had to endure. The humanity of her character and gentle nudge the writer gave to portraying her as a strong, capable young woman, but not in such a way that it ever diminished anyone else and their worth.Oh... and how can I not mention... Mr. Darcy... as the father-it was almost too much for my heart to handle. I adored how they reconciled at the end.And that again is why I'll say... this film was simply lovely in ever possible sense of the word!I loved every single bit of this movie-from beginning to end!Where to even begin: the cast; the costumes; the familiar crossover of the classic we've all seen in some variation or another throughout the years.I loved the whimsy of it all... the ease with which the characters lept from the screen and captured your attention with each moment.
