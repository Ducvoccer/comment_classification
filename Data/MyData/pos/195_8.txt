Filled with what eventually turns out to be a surprisingly effective balancing act of loopy/sincere performances by much of the cast (which itself is filled with layers of favorite performers from the past in cameos and supporting roles), "Instant Family" struck me as a much more raw, heartfelt, and hopeful portrayal of the highs and lows of foster care and adoption than I expected from the trailer. I enjoyed nearly every moment of it.
