This is a movie that is intensely funny and ruthlessly truthful, while never abandoning one goal for the other. NOT your standard dramedy.While the topic is foster parenting, it is about ALL aspects of parenting and family life. I saw it with my 14-year-old son (not adopted) and it inspired HIM to talk about our family and other families for more than an hour afterwards. He had me take him because is a fan of the "Daddy's Home" movies, which also have Mark Wahlburg and a seemingly similar theme, but this is much funnier and much more serious. He is planning to see it a second time with his mom.A "first-date" movie only for the fearless, but if you try it for that, you WILL laugh and you will find yourselves talking about a lot afterwards. A NECESSARY movie for any couple beginning to be more serious.
