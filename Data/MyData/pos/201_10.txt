I simply cannot get enough of this movie. Brilliant story telling from the director (the movie was based on his real life story, he adopted 3 kids) to touch on some of the depressing aspects of foster care and managing to keep the movie lighthearted.Octavia Spencer was great and the chemistry between Mark Wahlberg and Rose Byrne was off the charts, really had a family feel to it and both of them playing off of each other was great. Isabela Moner also does a good job of showing how some older kids up for adoption might feel guilty about leaving their birth parents and she portrays that conflict well.I'd definitely recommend watching it in the theaters, this movie doesn't seem to be getting as much love as it deserves.
