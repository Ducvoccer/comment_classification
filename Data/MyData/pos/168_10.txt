It's hard not to contemplate fostering kids after seeing this beautiful movie. I've always looked up to people who were able to leave their comfortable lives behind to put others first. If you're looking for a movie with unpredictable twists and turns, this isn't it. But the film's predictability doesn't take away from the perfect mix of humor and sincerity which left the audience very satisfied (at least speaking for myself and the people I saw the movie with).The acting was wonderful all around. Mark and Rose are great comedians and were endearing as a couple. The children were excellent at playing the role of kids who were mistreated by their biological family, then left to flounder in a foster system that's not nearly equipped to handle the amount of children neglected by the very people who brought them into this world. You could tell each of the three kids experienced different traumas in their lives which shaped them into people with three very individual personalities. Each child needed different care which couldn't have been easy for any foster parents. Even the supporting actors and actresses were funny.If you're in the mood for some humor and tears, but ultimately an uplifting experience, Instant Family is the movie for you. Now on to see Widows, which couldn't be more different!
