Like seriously. This was the best movie I have ever seen. Maybe I'm getting caught up in the moment and the emotions but still it was up there and it will go down as one of the classics. Wow. I feel like I've been treated to the best experience of my life. Congrats to everyone involved. This movie is a work of art. Bring tissues with you FYI
