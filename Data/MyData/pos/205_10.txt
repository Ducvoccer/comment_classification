Mark Wahlberg is my total celebrity crush. Mostly for his role in Invincible and his personal work with family, community and country. I thought this would be a great movie for some laughs on a rainy day. It was that and so much more. Once again MW proves to be a loving and committed family man. Excellent excellent movie I will be definitely adding to the rotation. Congratulations to the whole Insant Family family.
