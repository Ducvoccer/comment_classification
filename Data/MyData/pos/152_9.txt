My husband and I could completely relate to this movie as we have a story almost identical to this, though we did not do it through Foster care. We adopted International children. They came to us as a sibling group of 5, unable to speak English and had many hidden disabilities. We were strengthened by the delightful sense of humor, the honest and real situations, and the all to familiar raw emotions that adoption brings to the parents who do this challenging task. Even the happy moments of starting to sense the "family" connection all rang true to our hearts. Thank you so much for making this film. It encouraged, it uplifted and it helped us know that we are not alone..... There was a lot of cussing that seemed unnecessary, but over all was a great film to watch.
