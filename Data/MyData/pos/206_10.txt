This movie was my wife's choice. I'm so glad she suggested it to me. The acting was some of the best I have seen. I knew of Mark Wahlberg but his movies had never appealed to me. I had never heard of Isabela Moner but she uses the Spanish spelling of Isabela so I thought she must be good. I also had never heard of Rose Byrne but she comes from the same country as Daniel Lissing so though she must be good. I went mainly on the power of Octavia Spencer, whom I had seen in "Counting Numbers" and "The Shack". She did not disappoint. Also Wahlberg Moner and Byrne did a wonderful job. Moner will be a rising star. She was especially good. But then the surprise with so many great actors with small parts: Charlie McDermott (I loved "The Middle", Julie Hagerty (all the Airplane movies plus so much more), Margo Martindale (from "A Gifted Man"), and Joan Cusack (from so many great movies) all really added to this movie. Did I list enough stars for you?
But these stars were able to give great performances because they had such a wonderful script. It was funny, dramatic and oh so clean. Probably the professional movie critics hate it because it did not depend on sex and violence to tell the story.
