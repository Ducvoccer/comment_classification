Cast:
Some standouts, but mostly 'meh' if I am being honest. My favourites were Clara and The Nutcracker, because I actually enjoyed the chemistry between the two of them. Some of others got annoying after a while, though were still decent.Scenery:
My second favourite aspect of this film! I loved the way everything was designed...it felt very cartoony and unrealistic, yet realistic (in some ways) at the same time. I absolutely loved how the four realms were designed (very unique to each), though I wish we could have seen a bit more of them. London was okay.Costumes:
Here is my top aspect of the film! I loved the costumes so much...maybe a little too much, because at some points I found myself distracted by them. But I just loved the vibrant design and colour of them! Especially (I don't really think it's a spoiler because it is in the trailers...) Clara's soldier dress! That was my favourite!Storyline:
Simple, though I did have a bit of trouble following along. I basically just knew what was happening because I know the original story of The Nutcracker.Soundtrack:
Even though there was not much dancing (quick side note: the dancing that was done was really well done!), I was super happy that they added the classic and iconic music from The Nutcracker ballet, because it is my favourite instrumental soundtrack ever! It really did add to the film for me personally, and even the other music fit in nicely.Overall:
Overall, this film was a nice updated retelling of the classic story we know. But, if you are looking for that classic story, and/or a lot of dancing, you will be disappointed. I did like the four realms, and the story behind them, as well as Clara's (maybe a little bit of a spoiler?) smarts. Go in to the movie expecting a change to the story, and you will not be let down.Cast:
