Instant Family is a movie about the unconditional love of the family towards their three foster siblings, who are from a difficult background. This unconditional love extended a variety of difficult situations. This movie presents the fact that everyone is human and makes mistakes but shared a message of grace and love that transcends those mistakes. Even despite the mature themes and the unnecessary use of language that was used throughout this movie, the theme is what redeems this movie. Grace and love does have the ability to overcome a wide range of situations, which I believe is pivotal to remember in our own lives and in how we treat others.
