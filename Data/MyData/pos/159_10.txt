I laughed, I teared up, and I got frustrated with the system. Realistic but heartwarming depiction of the foster system. They show a real family with real problems.
I especially loved how they dealt with the "white savior" criticism! It's a true story, and you can tell. For all the comments about bad language, obviously you haven't spent much time around foster kids! Again, totally realistic.
