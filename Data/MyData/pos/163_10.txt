Cant believe the average rating for this film is so low... If I could rate it more then 10 I would. I think its offensive people have said it was "predictable", I didnt know Mark Wahlberg produced it until after, which makes me apprciate it even more... The acting was phenomenal by everyone, but the " true story" was such a great example of how life really works, ups and downs, "grass is greener", everyone just wants to love and be loved, especially kids!! I hope it helps raise more awareness of how the "system" for fostering kids works and inspires people to help all the unfortunate kids who need it!! I never "love" movies, but this was amazing!
