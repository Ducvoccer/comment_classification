Maybe I'm just not into it but I left the cinema after this feeling hungry for one of my old favorite Christmas movies like miracle on 34th street. It's all fairy floss, no meat. It almost tries too hard. I can't really figure what this movie has to do with Christmas either aside from the familiar looking soldier. It didn't make me glow with Christmas joy sadly. It's not awful. It's just not awesome either.Maybe I'm just not into it but I left the cinema after this feeling hungry for one of my old favorite Christmas movies like miracle on 34th street.
