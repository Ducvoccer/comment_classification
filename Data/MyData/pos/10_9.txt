I went into the movie hoping it was good but not sure how they could turn all the previous Nutcracker incarnations into a good movie. The movie was excellent! I really enjoyed it. It was very well done the visuals were incredible. And the concepts and storyline and plot twist were just really well done. I actually hope they make sequels for this. This could be Disney's next Pirates of the Caribbean style franchise.I went into the movie hoping it was good but not sure how they could turn all the previous Nutcracker incarnations into a good movie.
