I can't imagine why some are giving this movie such poor ratings. Please judge it for yourself, not what others say. It's a beautiful movie, beautiful in the way the story is told (perhaps not the classic version, but just as wonderful), beautiful in the way that lessons are told and people are inspired, beautiful in that the hero of the story is a simple man who finds himself in extraordinary circumstances. I will agree that while Mackenzie Foy was wonderful, and I very much enjoyed her performance, for me Jayden Fowara-Knight's role stole the show. He found himself a hero, as an ordinary man in extraordinary circumstances. The sets were incredible, from the first scene to the last. I loved them all, and found this story a perfect fairy tale. My granddaughter went with me, and loved it as much as I did! Bravo to all for a wonderful, wonderful movie!I can't imagine why some are giving this movie such poor ratings.
