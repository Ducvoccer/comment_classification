I saw this today. I understood the story just fine. Apparently, it was a mix of the ballet and a short story. I loved every minute of it. I was transformed to a fantasy world that I would like to see! The sets, costumes, hair, dancing, CGI was absolutely brilliant. I recommend this to anyone, especially the little ones. They will be mesmerized. Thrilling comes to mind.I saw this today. I understood the story just fine. Apparently, it was a mix of the ballet and a short story. I loved every minute of it.
