Full disclosure: I only enjoy a small margins of comedies. I avoid over-the-top comedies, slap stick comedies, or low-and-crude comedies, so because Mark Wahlberg was starring in this film, I was hesitant. But, I'm a fan of Rose Byrne, was OK with the trailers and curious about the situation, so I took a chance. And, despite the tone of the comedy being hyperbolic, there were some very touching moments. And... I was so pleased that I liked this movie. The story was humorous, the predicaments were plausible, the situations were heart pulling, the acting was solid (YAY Rose Burne, Octavia Spencer, Tig Notaro, Margo Martindale), the kids were cute, Isabela Moner was a stand out talent (she even kills it with her vocal talents during the credits). I enjoyed it. I give it a 7 (good) out of 10. {Comedy Drama}
