Let me just say that we are in the thick of the foster care system right now with a set of 3 siblings in our home. Tonight I took our 12 year old to see this. She loved it. We both laughed and I cried buckets but we both were able to see, understand, and agree on both sides. Her big takeaway..."I'm not like Lizzy!" I don't know what kind of thoughts were planted in her head with this movie, but from the parent side, every piece is so true. Can't wait to own this movie!
