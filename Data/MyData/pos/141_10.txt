If Hollywood has a belt, this movie is the buckle.Speaking as someone with no neuropathy issues whatsoever, big, thick happy and sad tears were streaming down my face the whole time. I had never seen so many tears. Good tears, fun tears, happy tears; I like that.Todd Segway stole the show in his scenes. Whether it was Girl-boy-girl, Boy-boy-girl-boy, whatever.Highly recommend seeing this film, so let's get physical at the movies.
