Yes this borrowed a lot from lion the witch and the wardrobe and alice in wonderland, but it's a kids film. I find reviews in here for kids films rod9culous. Do kids like it? Yes. At least my daughter did. Then it is good. As an adult it inspired the sense of wonder that drew me to the fantasy genre as a child. I loved the world even if the concept was somewhat old. The story itself was simple and reused, but so was avatar. Sometimes the old ones are the best.Yes this borrowed a lot from lion the witch and the wardrobe and alice in wonderland, but it's a kids film. I find reviews in here for kids films rod9culous.
