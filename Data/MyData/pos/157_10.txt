I never review but this was SUCH an amazing movie !! A hilarious, heartfelt movie.Ya laugh, ya cry (more laughing though!!) not many movies get a round of applause multiple times, as well as at the end from the audience like this one did. The kids loved it too! (Fine for kids if you aren't too picky.. a few bad words here and there) It was SO much better than I even expected ! The preview didn't do it justice!
