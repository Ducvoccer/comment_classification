This movie was so well created, it was so inspiring. The message of the movie was so clear. Most importantly it focuses on a family reunion, also there's not a single kissing scene. This film is appropriate for all the nations. I wish Disney build their upcoming projects as beautiful as the Nutcracker and the Four Realms.This movie was so well created, it was so inspiring.
