I saw this film as a preview at a nationwide adoption conference with a group of professionals in the field, and to a person, we loved this movie! As both an adoption specialist and a father of four young men adopted as teens from foster care, I can confirm that every note of this film rang true: the highs, the lows, the frustration and anger and times you want to give up, and the times you rise to levels you didn't know you could reach. And it's FUNNY! Between the touching moments is real laugh-out-loud humor. The director was able to find the fun without MAKING fun. Excellent performances all around too. Whether you are interested in the adoption aspect or you just want to see a good, funny family story, I can't recommend this movie enough!
