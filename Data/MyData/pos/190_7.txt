I saw "Instant Family", starring Mark Wahlberg-The Daddy's Home movies, Transformers:The Last Knight; Rose Byrne-The Insidious movies, the X-Men movies; Isabela Moner-Sicario:Day of the Socdado, Transformers:The Last Knight and Octavia Spencer-The Shape of Water, Halloween 2_2009.
This movie was written and directed by Sean Anders-Daddy's Home 1 & 2, Horrible Bosses 2, That's My Boy-and is based on his own experiences in adopting his own children. Mark and Rose play a financially successful childless couple that decide to adopt a child-their parents & friends are pressuring them about having kids. Octavia plays the adoption go-between that is having a meet & greet of adoptable children and perspective parents. Isabela plays the teen that catches Mark & Rose's attention but Isabela comes with 2 more siblings, so it's a threefer. Have Mark & Rose taken on more than they can handle? This is a comedy but it does have touching moments, too. Isabela's birth mother comes back into the picture to complicate matters and there are issues to deal with as to who should have custody of the children-plus, who the children want to go with.
It's rated "PG-13" for language, drug references and sexual material-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 59 minutes.
I enjoyed it and would probably buy it on DVD.
