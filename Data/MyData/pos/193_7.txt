This film will definitely put a smile on your face. It's not quite as funny as it intends, but the well-intentioned story makes up for a lot of its flaws. Mark Wahlberg is actually pretty well-suited in this role and I liked his performance. Rose Byrne is a treat as well. More than anything, it's hard not to feel good after watching this movie.
