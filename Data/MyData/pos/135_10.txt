First, let me say that my wife and I go to the movies every Friday. We see a LOT of movies. We usually agree about how good or bad a film was, and we both agreed on Instant Family. It's fantastic. I wish I could give it more than 10 stars because the current score of 7.3 is really not doing this film justice. It's simply a perfect movie. My wife and I cried a lot, laughed a lot, and left the theater happy. Based on a true story...they did a wonderful job of re-telling it for the screen. Reminds me of Wonder, which was also underrated. If I could vote for the Oscar's, it would've been Wonder last year and Instant Family this year. I don't even need to see the other contenders. Wish movies like this would get an Oscar nom... but it's usually the serious dramas that get them. Wahlberg should be very proud. He produced it and co-starred in it. Very happy for him. Hope this means more films like this and less violence in the future. Please go see it and give it your review here. It will help get the word out.
