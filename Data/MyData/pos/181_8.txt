This movie is going to get overlooked by other fantastic movies this year, but it is well worth a watch. Explores great familial themes and really taps into the human aspect of things while supplying good comedy breaks here and there. It is definitely not a full fledged comedy as there are some serious eye-jerking moments, but well done to all actors and actresses involved!
