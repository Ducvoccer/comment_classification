With each holiday season, we're reminded of stories like A Christmas Carol, How the Grinch Stole Christmas and even A Visit from St. Nicholas. The story of the Nutcracker is another one often seen. Though originally starting as a novel titled "The Nutcracker and the Mouse King", most people remember it as a ballet that was composed by Tchaikovsky. A lot remember either performing in it or having a six year old that performed in it. It has little nostalgia value to me, but I can't deny that the image of the Nutcracker has become synonymous with Christmas. So why haven't there been more adaptations?
