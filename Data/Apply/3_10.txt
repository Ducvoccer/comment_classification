"The Nutcracker and the Four Realms" is one of the best live-action Disney film. It contains all the magic and the score by James Newton Howard perfectly contains the beloved suits from "The Nutcracker" by Tchaikovsky, while also being new. Keira Knightley is perfect as the Sugar Plum Fairy. Great family film!
