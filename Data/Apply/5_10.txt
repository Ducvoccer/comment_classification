I can be a very tough reviewer sometimes but i have nothing to say except that this movie is amazing. Really reminds me of my childhood and all of the Disney movies i would see. Reminded me of Alice in Wonderland and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. It's wonderful, one of the best movies to see as a family. Highly recommend you see this movie when it comes out in theatres. - Eludo
