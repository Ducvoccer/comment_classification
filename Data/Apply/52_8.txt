This movie works really well for kids who love imagination. My kids (8,6,3) all loved the movie. The visuals are absolutely stunning and the music is wonderful. The plot is a bit convoluted and there are certainly some unnecessary aspects, but nothing that is too distracting. This is absolutely a popcorn movie, just go enjoy the visuals and the fun, don't try to analyze it as high art.
