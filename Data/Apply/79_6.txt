First "Wrinkle in Time" and then "The Nutcracker and the Four Realms" (there is "Christopher Robin", but that's very good movie). Both awful movies in their genre. What is my problem with "The Nutcraker and the Four Realms"? Disney Studios lost their magic. Disney started to add sad backstories in their new movies. In "Christopher Robin", Robin doesn't have time for his children. In "Mary Poppins Returns" trailer, Michael's wife is dead and his kids don't have mother. But, in this movie, Clara doesn't have mother, too, and her father is completely lost. Story is too simple, boring and predictable. Acting is very overrated, to me it seems like actors really like how they are acting in this movie. SOME JUMPSCARES ARE IN THE MOVIE BUT THEY ARE VERY POOR. A scene with creepy clowns and giant Mother Ginger puppet doll scared children in cinemas. Great job, Disney! On other side, there is something good in this pot. Costume Design, Production Design and Music (at several points) is absolutely terrific. Great job! First scene, with flying eagle, bought me. THAT WAS GREAT! Should you see this movie? Not my suggestion, but if you want to spend your time and money at stupid movie, go ahead! Alternatives, a walk in the countryside, go fishing or watch Bohemian Rhapsody in cinemas. Your choice, folks!
