I don't think I have ever been more impressed - and simultaneously disappointed - in a Disney movie in my entire life! The Nutcracker and the Four Realms is a gorgeously filmed fairy tale, filled with absolutely stunning visual scenes. The CGI images are wondrously and seamlessly integrated with the "real" actors and the plot has all the necessary ingredients of an exciting and fanciful adventure. Mackenzie Foy as Clara does a credible job as the main character, and veterans Morgan Freeman and Helen Mirren add necessary interest to their roles. But if anyone "steals the show," it would be Keira Knightley as Sugar Plum.
