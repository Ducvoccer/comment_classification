I'm not comparing this to anything else. This isn't some grand Oscar winning movie. However, as a re-imagined take on the traditional nutcracker story I found it to be enjoyable. So did the crew of 7 adults and 10 kids who saw it. The acting was great, the costumes inspiring, so much so that all the kids and adults want to "be that for Halloween".
