Sadly, this film is not good! The small amount of Helen mirren and Morgan Freeman you see And the delightful Mckenzie foy, Unfortunately are not enough to warrant seeing this! The costumes are terrible,really terrible, Kiera knightly's acting is by far the worst I've seen since Elton johns awful appearance in the second kingsmen film! The entire film lacks flow,story,continuity and is above all boring.The four of us that went all agreed it was probably the worst film we've seen and we visit the cinema a lot! Such a shame, just laughably badly made/designed costumes,shocking acting,week storyline and no real pull to keep you watching. Mckenzie foy however, shows real potential so I hope to see her in a better film soon
