After watching the trailer to this film, I was excited because this looked really good. Watching it though is a whole other story. This has to be one of the worse movies of 2018. The problems that I have with this film is that nothing make sense. The film doesn't explain what happened and you just don't understand the plot. They try to make things interesting in the 3rd act of this film but you just don't care, because it doesn't give you a reason to care. And that twist at the end of the film, is so incredibly predictable, you'll see it coming a mile away. And it is boring as F, I honestly dozzed off during this film because it is just not interesting at all. I think the best thing about this film was I guess Mackenzie Foy, I mean she did great with what she had. So i give props to her.
