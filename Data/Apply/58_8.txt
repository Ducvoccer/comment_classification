This movie did not disappoint. I got almost exactly what I was expecting- a visually beautiful beautiful fairy tale (where a good part of my stars go to). You can't really expect to have psychological debates on the story, nor will it leave you with any new knowledge on life on this planet (what fairy tale movie does?!). But it does its job well. Costumes, make up, design, music were just magical! May be it's just me, but I saw the movie also paying homage to "The Swan lake", which was a nice touch. Clara's music egg played the music from one of my favorite parts from the ballet and I loved it.
