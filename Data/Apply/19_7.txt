Maybe it's just me, but I had a hard time really getting into this movie at first, even with the great Morgan Freeman wearing an Eyepatch of Power. Things started to pick up later on, when the more fantastical elements started to kick in, and especially when Sugar Plum did her Face-Heel Turn. That made things much more interesting. After that, the happy ending was pretty standard, but heartfelt all the same. My rating: 7/10.
