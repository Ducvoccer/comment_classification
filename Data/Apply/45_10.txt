Sooo many negative reviews for a children's movie?! ... by no means was this on the level of the insanity of The Wrinkle in Time hot mess. I enjoyed the new take on the old tale a very fun whimsical story with obviously stunning effects. When I saw the movie it was in 3D DBox so it was like being apart of the movie there was not one time I felt bored. The only drawback was the father he was more creepy then Mother Ginger's clowns.
