The Nutcracker was short, but that was good, because after a nice relaxing movie you could go straight to lunch or do whatever your family needs to. I thought that Clara was brave and was committed to what she wanted. Mother Ginger didn't actually look scary in person, so I thought she was sweet. My hypothesis was correct. As soon as I saw Sugar Plum, after Clara got the key, I knew something was wrong. And like I said before, my hypothesis was better than I thought.
