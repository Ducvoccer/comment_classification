This movie works really well for kids who love imagination. My kids (8,6,3) all loved the movie. The visuals are absolutely stunning and the music is wonderful. The plot is a bit convoluted and there are certainly some unnecessary aspects, but nothing that is too distracting. This is absolutely a popcorn movie, just go enjoy the visuals and the fun, don't try to analyze it as high art.Unfortunately, as a typical Disney movie, it revolves around a child who lost a parent and must learn to deal with it. But the ending justify's the emotions pretty well and it is all handled in a healthy way.There are a few semi-intense scenes where they got nervous, but nothing really scary happened. The relationship of the main character and the nutcracker is a little odd (are they flirting? is he even real?) but it is not a main plot point so it is a minor issue.
