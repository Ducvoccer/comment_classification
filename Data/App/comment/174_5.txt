I didn't expect much from this movie, and yet I'm still let down. Don't get me wrong, I think kids would find this enjoyable anyway and there are some parts that earned a giggle and a wow. Costumes and the stage are well made as per Disney's standard.The story is pretty predictable even to the 'plot twist', which is fine for a kids movie. I'll be honest, aside from the veterans like Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren, and Keira Knightley, everybody else's acting is a bit amateurish and wooden. I think they will eventually get better with more screen time. It's just. The story is really boring, and the main actress is not helping to make it interesting.I was utterly bored up to the scene where Misty Copeland danced for Clara, which is basically the peak of the movie for me. Only then I felt I didn't waste my money.
