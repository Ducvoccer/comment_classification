The storyline is of course inspired by the original Ballet, but was changed to give it more depth and meaning. Still, it is quite predictable and not truly touching. Yet, seeing the film is an adoption of the ballet, and since the ballet was mostly a feel-good christmas event, it stays true to the original and probably was not meant to have much depth.
The mood of the film is like the ballet: it is cosy due to the christmas theme, playful due to the music (composed by Tchaikovsky) and a bit freaky due to the costumes. The scenery and interior is probably influenced by Russia and France, the countries from which the ballet originate, and is absolutely stunning.
The film also contains parts of the actual choreography, beautifully performed and pictured in my opinion.
I enjoyed it a lot, even though it is mostly thanks to the visual beauty.
