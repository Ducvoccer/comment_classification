This is probably one of the prettiest disney movies I've ever seen! The costumes were absolutely stunning and I love how they incorporated bits of ballet into the movie...BUT the story was dull and boring! And it's not like the actors weren't capable...I mean Helen Mirren and Keira Knightly are great actors and the rest of the cast didn't seem to shabby either but it's just that the story was so predictable, corny and none of the characters were particularly likable or interesting!
So if amazing visuals is enough for you then watch this movie, but if a good story is most important, you should rather pass on this!
