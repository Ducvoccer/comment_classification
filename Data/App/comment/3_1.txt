At its attempt to be unique and edgy, the creators made a film that is real cheesy, at times boring, predictable, and unnecessarily dramatic in the choice of music and manner with which particular characters responded to each other.I was very disappointed because I love the story of the Nutcracker. This adaptation really tanked.
