I had a blast with this movie, but not in the way I imagined. I was making fun of how terrible it actually was to watch this.The film is boring, the acting is dull and ridiculous at times from most actors (they never try to do anything outside of their script to put some emotion into their characters), the CGI (surprisingly) was pretty terrible and I was surprised to see such a mess of things happening on the screen at once (I hate when films overuse it, it takes away from my experience), the action is pathetically choreographed, the plot is dull and forgettable, the dialogue is horrible (but like absolutely horrible mind you), and this film doesn't do anything more than meet Disneys agenda.I think it's a problem that a company as bloated as Disney doesn't care to keep track of the mess they leave behind sometimes, they know they will make money of anything (like toys) if the movie fails, so they don't run any risks. It's sad that they will never get feedback, and that they will never care again.My final score: 3.9/10
