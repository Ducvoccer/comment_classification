I saw this with my family and we all went in not expecting much because of low scores from critics but we all ended up really enjoying it! The music, special effects, costumes, and production design all came together to create magic on the big screen. The snippets of dancing and homage paid to the original ballet was beautifully done and perfectly placed into the story. The story itself might've been predictable, but still had it's fair share of twists, and was still full of heart and Christmas spirit. I enjoyed the uplifting themes woven into the story about family, dealing with the loss of loved ones, and to not judge appearances. I still don't understand the bad reviews from critics, but as a casual moviegoer who's just somewhat familiar with the original nutcracker story, I loved this retelling and would definitely recommend it, especially for the Holiday season. (I disagreed with bad reviews so much I created an account JUST to write this, haha)
