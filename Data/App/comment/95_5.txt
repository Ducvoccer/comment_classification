It's pretty, has a pretty nice atmosphere and setting, but that's mostly all that's good. It's very predictable and formulaic,not to mention boring... The highlights are when Helen Mirren or Morgan Freeman are on screen, but these are a few short scenes and further prove how mediocre this movie otherwise is.
