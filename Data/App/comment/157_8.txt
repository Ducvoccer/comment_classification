I absolutely loved the imagery and the animation. It reminded me of Alice in Wonderland. I enjoyed the movie a lot because of the adventure and the world, it was beautiful. It is for children since the writing isn't very complex, it's very straightforward and doesn't confuse you. The movie is not as bad as the reviews make it.
