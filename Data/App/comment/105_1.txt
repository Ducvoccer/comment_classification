This had to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's so bad I had to write a review of it. There was so much overacting I wanted to puke. My bf fell asleep during it because of how slow and boring it was. The story was dumb and of corse the girl didn't have a mother as all Disney movies...so cliche. *Barf* The only thing kind of good was the outfits, which were...interesting...I mean they were Christmas ornaments so... Here's another surprise, wait till the ending with the half nude ballerina dancer dude and the overly muscular woman at the end. Wait till you see his nipple and bulge in his white tights on big screen, enjoy the show kiddos!Ps. The original is way better than this garbage.
