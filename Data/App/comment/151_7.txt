This movie was gorgeous - the costumes, the actors, the sets, and the CGI-animated characters. For me, I felt the music was sprinkled throughout at just the right moments - if I wanted the musical, I would go see it on stage or via a recorded session. This movie was not intended to be a rehash of the musical but instead it was meant to serve as an interpretation of the story. It had all of the right elements for me, as a viewer, and the story picked up about 15 minutes in. I'm not saying this movie was amazing - I love all genres and a rating of a 7 from me means it could've been better but I'm not asking for my money back because the film did its job. I'm really interested to see if kids today love this movie because I feel we adults critique this film based on decades of growing up with the musical.
