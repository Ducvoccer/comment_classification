As a LOVER of all things Disney and the Nutcracker ballet, I wanted to love this film so bad. I have been dying of anticipation. Much to my dismay, it was one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. The plot was all over the place, acting was mediocre (which is shocking because there are some great casts), and it was too different from the story for me. I usually recommended people to go see Disney movies just to see it, but I'm telling you..wait until Redbox. I'm so disappointed.
