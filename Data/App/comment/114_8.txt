I'm not comparing this to anything else. This isn't some grand Oscar winning movie. However, as a re-imagined take on the traditional nutcracker story I found it to be enjoyable. So did the crew of 7 adults and 10 kids who saw it. The acting was great, the costumes inspiring, so much so that all the kids and adults want to "be that for Halloween".Not every film needs to be Oscar worthy to be considered worth seeing. I was thrilled to see Misty Copeland dancing. I loved how the music was woven in. As someone who has seen "The Nutcracker" ballet countless times I was intrigued by how the different aspects of the original story were sprinkled throughout. This movie is great for families. Kids about 5 & up will be fine. There's a few parts they may need to hold a hand, and then they'll be great.Some people like to rip apart films that most families will absolutely enjoy.
