Loved the story line! The graphics were amazing. The dancing and scenes on the stage were very well done. The music of course was perfectly composed! I've seen and have loved the nutcracker since I've been a child. Tchaikovsky score is one of my favorites!! My friend and her granddaughter were hesitant about going, and ended up loving the movie.
