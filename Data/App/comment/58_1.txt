Once upon a time, I had a first date with someone. I took this someone to see The Nutcracker and the Four Realms, hoping it'd be enjoyable and full of laughs for us. What the hell did we watch?The thing that makes it bad is not the story line, which has been overdone to death and was so predictable that me and the date called the ending several minutes before it ended. A typical storyline like this can work well if the actors are into the performance and if it is written well. The problem is...it isn't. We don't get much backstory at all. We just know that the mom has died and now she's left her daughter to go on a quest.The performances are either over the top or not believable at all. I can see a hyperactive kid who likes adventure getting very bored with this movie. I found myself checking my phone. We don't really get much in the way of "action" until around 45 minutes into the film, which for a children's flick that's supposed to be about energy, is probably way too long for them. I'm 20, and it's too long for the child in me as well.The lead actress in this was worse than paint drying. Literally anyone could have acted better. Can the woman just...pretend to care about what she's in?If you're looking for something to shut up your kid for 90 minutes, than this is for you. If you're looking for something good, chose otherwise.
