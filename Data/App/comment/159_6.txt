This movie was an extremely beautiful film. The set designs and the costume design were totally worth the theatre experience. The story was fine, but could have been way better. I'm just surprised that people are giving it a 1 star review. I'd give it between a 4 and a 6 at the least. 1 is like, the movie is pure filth and there's nothing even remotely good about it. This movie definitely is a nice little Christmas treat. I can even imagine years down the road this film might get some love just for the wonky set designs. Eh who knows.
