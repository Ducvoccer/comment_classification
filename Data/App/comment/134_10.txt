The Nutcracker and the Four Realms is a beautiful and poetic film. The music and the costumes are really amazing, and the story praises love, courage, memories and strength. The visuals are absolutely stunning. I read that many people trashed the film. I'm not surprised. This film is too beautiful and too poetic for this era of stupid superheroes films. If you like poetry, music, and dance, go see this film. Take somebody you love, eat some popcorn and enjoy.
PS: The film is scary for little children. Go with your kids if they are 10-12 years old or older.
