Children's animated fantasy adventure mixed with live action from Disney.A little bit of "Lion, Witch & Wardrobe", with some "Harry Potter" and a sprinkling of "Alice in Wonderland".They could have made a better film if it had included some humour for parents, but still just about passable if you're eight years old.
