After having watched this movie I was impressed with the simplistic approach to the subject matter, and I think that helped to make it an even better movie. Yes it's easy to nit pick at it as some have done but many great movies in the past you could have done the same. I think the story has a realistic feel with a touch of magic, something which every child over 6 could understand yet fed with an undertone which only an adult would understand.The movie reminded me very much of the Princess Diaries and just as well made (if not better in some parts).My recommendation is for all young and old to see and just enjoy a very good fun movie.
