To be sure, The Nutcrucker and the Mouse King, is a different story. Its villains are straightforward villains, its heroes seem simpler, but like the more famous Danish fairytale author extraordinaire, H. C. Andersen, his artistic fairytales have deeper layers which Disney wouldn't reach, ever. Disney, doesn't stand for hidden depth. It stands for good story telling, good characters, and great artistic design. And we sure get it all in this version of the Nutcrucker. And ever since Enchanted, Disney also stands for what I call TTT - Turned Tables Trend - of Disney's movies, where Disney's grandees decided that in order to join the modern age they must add some sort of a plot twist to their movies. And they did it so relentlessly that I consider it a surprise when they tell a story where the villain is really the actual villain and when the hero's road to victory is straightforward.As I said it here beforehand this became so ridiculous, that certain movies ended being plainly stupid (Into the Wood), but sometimes they do get their story all right, and then all their strengthes combine well into a charming story. In my book, this one such case. What we got here is a charming fantasy, with the recently required strong female character, that seems to extract some special hate on this site, and I can't understand why. Again, I already said it here, but I realize I must say it again: this is a commercial trend, but the entire movie business is commercial, and other commercial trends didn't get such quantities of passionate hatred.One last remark, In my personal book, I've never seen Keira Knightley doing a better job. I personally think that the Sugar Plum Fairy over the top character suits her acting abilities to perfection. I heard her saying she doesn't know if she'll ever find another such role. I hope she does, we all deserve it.
