1 of the best parts about 'The nutcracker and the 4 realms' is the actual ballet, filmed on Misty Copeland and team in 3D, that forms a ('an' inorganic) part of the movie (plus, at the end).Prod design is top-notch.
Music predictable, but decent.
Casting good, performances average (McFadyen is fantastic, as always)....Overall, other than a few positives, and the ballet sequences, both during the movie, and during the end-credits - meh.But viewing the ballet sequences are worth the price of admission....go figure.Most of the other things about the movie are missed opportunities, and as such, forgettable.
