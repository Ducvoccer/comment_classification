I don't think I have ever been more impressed - and simultaneously disappointed - in a Disney movie in my entire life! The Nutcracker and the Four Realms is a gorgeously filmed fairy tale, filled with absolutely stunning visual scenes. The CGI images are wondrously and seamlessly integrated with the "real" actors and the plot has all the necessary ingredients of an exciting and fanciful adventure. Mackenzie Foy as Clara does a credible job as the main character, and veterans Morgan Freeman and Helen Mirren add necessary interest to their roles. But if anyone "steals the show," it would be Keira Knightley as Sugar Plum.However, having enjoyed numerous productions of the Tchaikovsky ballet over the years as an annual Christmas tradition (in earlier days), I was dismayed to find that this film is clearly in the category of "inspired by," and not "based on" its famous predecessor. I was hoping that the movie would use Tchaikovsky's themes and perhaps mirror the (admittedly limited) structure of the ballet. Although the score hints at the original composition from time to time and there are some very beautiful ballet scenes (including during the closing credits) the film is only superficially related to the original.That said, my guess is that seeing it again - without my "originalist" expectations - I might enjoy the film even more than the first time. Also, the visuals are at times so incredibly rich, this film may achieve in time a high level of acceptance on its own merits. So my advice is, by all means, go see this movie and enjoy it for what it is: a new Disney fairy tale inspired by a beloved work of art. But be sure and leave your Nutcracker Ballet expectations at home before you go!
