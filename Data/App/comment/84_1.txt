Why is Disney so horrible at making live action movies? The only good ones are Mary Poppins and Pirates Of The Caribbean 1, everything else is mindless drivel that only tricks little girls and old people into seeing it. I saw this because I wanted to SEE how bad it was (also because I was forced to come along with my little cousin, who enjoyed it) and I was not disappointed. This was embarassingly awful with plot holes, an awful script, terrible actors and abysmal music. Please DO NOT WATCH, it only gives Disney encouragement to keep making these abominations of cinema.
