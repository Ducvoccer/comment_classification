The only thing about this movie I truly enjoyed were the visuals.
Thats about it. The soundtrack is just... a let down, it felt like I was listening to trailer music. There is just no soul in this movie, they somehow managed to kill the mystery of this story that I loved as a child. Just another blockbuster garbage.Its just horrible, like watching a much worse version of Alice in Wonderland.
