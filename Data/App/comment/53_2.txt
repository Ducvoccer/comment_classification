I can't remember the last time I walked out mid movie from a fantasy film. This was just a horrible effort on Disney's part. My husband and I were commenting that the sets and costumes were lovely, probably being lined up for a Disneyland ride, but the story made no sense, the acting was abysmal. The story fell flat, four realms were introduced but they seemed to play no part at all in the story, the acting by the "regents" was so over the top it reminded us of a third grade play. The complete 180 by sugar plum mid movie was ridiculous. Really, it was just annoying. I can't tell you how it ends because we just got up and left. And I do not have high artistic standards. All I want is a reasonably lucid plot and entertaining characters. Don't waste your time or money
