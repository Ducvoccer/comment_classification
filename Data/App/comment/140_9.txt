I have never cared too much for The Nutcracker story but after seeing the trailer for this film I thought I would give it a chance, even though critics and movie-goers alike seemed to think it was no good. Well, I don't know why other people said what they did about it, but I knew in the first three seconds-- literally-- that this was going to be a great picture.
Dame Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, and Keira Knightley are all great in their roles and Mackenzie Foy plays her part just as beautifully as she is herself.
The film is not lacking in any sense, as far as I'm concerned. The cinematography is absolutely STUNNING, the acting is great, and I there are a lot of innovative ideas that were incorporated into this classic story to make it feel refreshed and all the more interesting.
"The Nutcracker ..." is like a traditional Christmas dessert that you grew up enjoying year after year with some added spice and some delightful additions mixed in to make it all the more delectable this time around.
It's visually stunning, dramatic yet fun, dark yet playful, tender and sweet yet completely enthralling.Regardless what anyone says about this picture, all I really have to say is, GO WATCH IT. You will NOT be disappointed.
