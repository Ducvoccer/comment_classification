Having been a fan of the Tchaikovsky ballet since I was a boy, I got excited when I learned that they were doing a new live-action adaptation of it.However, upon seeing the first trailer, while the visuals looked pleasing, it seemed to me that the film was going to do that clichéd plot where the "chosen one" has to save a magical land from a wicked tyrant. Disney has done that story TWICE already with Alice and Wonderland (2010) and Oz the Great and Powerful (2013) but I still went to see it on the grounds that perhaps they would bring something new to the table.Although, I can now say that if you have seen the two films I previously mentioned, you don't need to see this one because there won't be any suspense as you will know everything that will happen.Not only that but in getting through all the clichéd plot points, the filmmakers left some holes. The villain got everyone under her thumb by making one of her fellow rulers the scapegoat but it is never explained how she convinced everybody that the other regent was evil. Also, why does she need a larger army if she has soldiers from three of the realms on her side?Additionally, while the costumes are beautifully designed, the eye-popping visuals that the trailer promised are few and far between. Having four different lands in the story was utterly pointless as the montage of Clara touring them lasted all of about ten seconds. 90% of the movie is set in the destroyed fourth realm which is shrouded in tones of black and grey. Seriously, they had magical realms of flower, snow and sweets in the story and THAT is what they focus on?Worst of all, the "Nutcracker" part of the title could easily be removed and it would make no difference whatsoever. The character to whom they gave that title was never cursed to be made of wood nor did he crack any nuts; he was just a normal human being. Tchaikovsky's music was scattered throughout the film in places where they could have used any other waltz and there was only a few seconds of ballet.I suppose children might enjoy this movie but those who go to it excepting a stunning, creative new take on the Christmas classic will leave sorely disappointed.
