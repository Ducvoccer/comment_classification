*Sigh* This film sucks. It's mediocre, it's boring, too much money has been thrown to create terrible looking CGI enviornments, the acting sucks, and the plot is another rehashed/uninspired adaptation of the classic/beautiful original story/play.Morgan Freeman is awful and feels thrown in because he's a famous actor, not because he was right for the role. The main cast is pretty bad as well and the art design/CGI looks like garbage. The only points I can give this film is that the shots were in focus. Aside from that skip this waste of time.As laughable as it is, I recommend 2010's abomination The Nutcracker the Untold story. Because in that one was memorable, weird, awkward, hilariously bad, but it also had some legitimatley good set design (specifically in Vienna). That one is memorable, this new one is not.
