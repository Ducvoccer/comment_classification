With a great streak of live action films, Disney takes a step back with Nutcracker. It's not the fall from grace that say, Maleficent felt like, but it's just a bland adaptation of beloved source material. There's just nothing special or significant about this version of The Nutcracker. It has gorgeous visuals, production & costume design, and a wealth of fantastic actors, but the script and direction feel incomplete. And I actually love a few of Lasse Hallstrom's films, so I was hopeful he could bring something special to Nutcracker, but having an inexperienced writer in Ashleigh Powell, perhaps wasn't the best decision. Or perhaps even more realistic, is that The Nutcracker (as a play) just isn't the easiest to translate into a straight narrative film. Either way, you can certainly skip this one.5.0/10
