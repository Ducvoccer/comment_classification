Do not believe all these paid for reviews that are glowing, giving 9 and 10 stars, this movie was terrible, storyline all over the place, mediocre acting all around special effects like a high school play! We couldn't wait to get out of there! Do yourself a favor and watch the trailer, all the best bits (and that's a stretch) were all there!
