I can't understand why there would be any negative reviews. I was mesmerized from start to finish. I am a big fan of the classic ballet The Nutcracker, but I went into this movie knowing it would be different and I wasn't disappointed. The movie was visually stunning-eye candy all the way. The production design and costumes will definitely transport you to another realm. Misty Copeland is The Ballerina. I watched this in 3D and had the chance to study her en pointe right in front of my nose! I just wish the movie had extended the scenes with Clara wearing the LED lit ballgown.
