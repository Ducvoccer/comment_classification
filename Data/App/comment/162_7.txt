First of all, this is not the classical story of the Nutcracker, so if you are expecting a movie similar to the novel you will be disappointed. Only the protagonists - Clara and the Nutcracker - are the same, but the rest of the plot is totally invented by Disney, with the intention to create something new and different.
The result is nice but not so good, despite the presence of wellknown actors such as Keira Knightley and Morgan Freeman. Wonderful the scenes and locations, however what is lacking is the plot, easy and banal in several points, full of commonplaces.
I appreciated the idea of choosing a black boy for the role of the Nutcracker, so that the movie can help integration and acceptation of the differences, especially considering the young public that it has.
