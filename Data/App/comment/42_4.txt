Since I adore Disney, Christmas ánd ballet I figured this movie would be worth the wait! Boy was I wrong..It starts out great with the owl flying over a winter landscape, I also loved the scene where Clara follows the rope and I thought my waiting for this movie would be rewarded... but from the moment Clara meets the Nutcracker it all goes downhill.*First the acting; Mackenzie Foy did good, but she was the only one. All the rest was flat and I was annoyed by the acting of the Nutcracker.
*The costumes overall were ok but when I saw Hawthorn with his green eyebrows and Shiver with his plastic icicles I had to keep myself from laughing.
*Then the biggest flaw of them all; the plot. It was all over the place... I was left with so many questions unanswered;
-Why did her mother send Clara to this world? Did she know there was a war? If so, why didn't she go and save the realms? Why did she not want her other children to go see this world?
-Howcome everybody simply believed what Sugar Plum said about Mother Ginger? And what exactly díd she say Mother Ginger had done? Did everybody simply believe Mother Ginger attacked the realm without anybody ever seeing anything?
-What on earth was the point of sending the owl along with Clara?
-Marie said Clara was her best creation...uhh..what about her other 2 children?
-What had happened to all the inhabitants of the realm of Amusements?
-The ballet shown to Clara is the story of how her mother discovered the realms and met the people...but isn't she the one who created all the people?
I could go on and on but you get the gist.Overall; a pretty picture without any content.
